abstract = {A case of artificial paranoid has been synthesized in the form of a computer simulation model. The model and its embodied theory are briefly described. Several excerpts from interviews with the model are presented to illustrate its paranoid input-output behavior. Evaluation of the success of the simulation will depend upon indistinguishability tests.}
